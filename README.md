# Multiple-Linear-Regression-Real-State
Multiple linear regression using StatsModels to predict the housing price based on the size, year and if the house has a view or not.

# Credit
The dataset and proposal of the exercise is from the Udemy course [The Data Science Course 2022: Complete Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp/). I highly recommend this course for those learning Python and machine learning.

# Analysis of results
The overall model is significant given that F-statistic:	335.2 with a Prob (F-statistic): 1.02e-50 << 0.05. In addition, all variables are statistically significant as well, since P>|t|.
